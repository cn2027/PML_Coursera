## Loading and preprocessing the data
location <- getwd()
file <- "repdata-data-activity.zip"
file.path(location,file)
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip", file.path(location,file))
activity<-read.csv(unzip(file.path(location,file), "activity.csv",list=FALSE),header=TRUE)
head(activity)
activity$steps<-as.numeric(activity$steps)
sapply(activity,class)
hist(activity$steps,xlab="Steps",main="Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day",)

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
